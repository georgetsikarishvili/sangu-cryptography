RSA vs AES Performance and Usage

RSA:
- Asymmetric (uses public & private key)
- Slow and computationally expensive
- Used mainly for exchanging keys or signing data
- Not suitable for encrypting large files

AES:
- Symmetric (same key for encryption & decryption)
- Very fast and efficient
- Used for bulk data encryption (files, databases, VPNs)

Conclusion:
In real systems, RSA is typically used to encrypt an AES key, 
and AES is used to encrypt the actual data.
