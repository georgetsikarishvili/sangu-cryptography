=========

TLS HANDSHAKE EXPLANATION

ClientHello sent (client proposes TLS 1.2, list of cipher suites, SNI tnet.ge).
ServerHello responded selecting TLS 1.2 with cipher AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 
Server sent "Change Cipher Spec"
Client also sent "Change Cipher Spec"
Server sent Certificate message tnet.ge -> GTS Root R4.
Server sent ServerFinished.


MITM PROTECTION MECHANISMS

Certificate validation: client verifies server cert chain up to a trusted root CA and checks signature on each cert.
Digital signatures: CA signs certificates with private key; clients verify using CA public key.
SNI + hostname check: client checks cert SANs/Subject matches requested hostname.
Forward Secrecy (ECDHE): ephemeral key exchange means long-term private key compromise does not reveal past session data.

TLS APPLICATION IN WEBSITES

Confidentiality: symmetric encryption (AES-GCM) protects payload from eavesdroppers.
Integrity: AEAD modes provide tamper detection for each record.
Authentication: server identity verified via certificate chain anchored to CA trust store.
Session resumption and 0-RTT (TLS 1.2) trade-offs and considerations.
