Diffie-Hellman key exchange is widely used in secure communication protocols such as TLS (HTTPS) and secure messaging apps like Signal.
In TLS, it allows the client and server to securely agree on a shared encryption key even over an untrusted network — without ever transmitting the key itself.
This ensures confidentiality (only both parties can decrypt messages) and provides forward secrecy, meaning even if one session key is compromised, past communications remain secure.
